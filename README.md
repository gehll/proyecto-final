The repo contains the jupyter notebook needed to fine-tune the model to detect the desired regions from the golf scorecards. All that you will need to do is once you have created the **images** folder inside colab, create two new folders inside: **train** and **test**. O each folder you will have to drop the corresponding images and annotations (.xml) files. **You must do this before creating the .record files**.
